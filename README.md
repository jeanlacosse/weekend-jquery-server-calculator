# Project Name
Calculator

## Description
This project took two days to develop.

I wanted to create an app that could process basic calculations on the server, while posting those calculations to a database.

I was looking to use jquery, ajax, and server side logic in order to work with the given numbers and operators a user might input.

### Prerequisites

- JQuery
- Javascript
- Ajax
- SQL
- CSS

## Installation

1. Create a database named `calculator`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run start` in your terminal
5. Navigate to localhost:5000 in the browser in order to use the app

## Usage

1. using the calculator interface to enter a number, an operator, and another number.
2. Clicking = will run the calcualtion and show the answer below
3. Past answers will stay available to see

## Built With

- JQuery
- Javascript
- Ajax
- SQL
- CSS
